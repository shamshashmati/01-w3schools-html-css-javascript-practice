<!-- 01 :  JavaScript Objects

        You have already learned that JavaScript variables are containers for data values.

        This code assigns a simple value (Fiat) to a variable named car. 
    
                let car = "Fiat";

    02 :   Object Definition

        You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal.  
        
    03 :   What is this?  
    
            In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.

        Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called).

        The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:

                    In an object method, this refers to the object.
            Alone, this refers to the global object.
            In a function, this refers to the global object.
            In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
            In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
            Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.

    04 :   The this Keyword
    
            In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.

        In the example above, this is the person object that "owns" the fullName function.

        In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object.
