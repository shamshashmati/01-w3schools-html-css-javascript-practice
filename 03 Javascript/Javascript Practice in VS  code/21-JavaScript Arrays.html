<!-- 01 : Array Defination

        It stores multiple values and elements in one variable. These values can be of any data type â€” meaning you can store a
        string, number, boolean, and other data types in one variable 

    02  : Why Use Arrays?
        
            If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:

            let car1 = "Saab";
            let car2 = "Volvo";
            let car3 = "BMW";
            However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?

            The solution is an array!

            An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.

    03  : 
            Spaces and line breaks are not important. A declaration can span multiple lines:    
            
    04  : Arrays are Objects
    
            Arrays are a special type of objects. The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays.

            But, JavaScript arrays are best described as arrays.

            Arrays use numbers to access its "elements". In this example, person[0] returns John:

    05  : Array Elements Can Be Objects
    
            JavaScript variables can be objects. Arrays are special kinds of objects.

            Because of this, you can have variables of different types in the same Array.

            You can have objects in an Array. You can have functions in an Array. You can have arrays in an Array:  
            
    06  : Array Properties and Methods
    
            The real strength of JavaScript arrays are the built-in array properties and methods:

    07  : Looping Array Elements
    
            One way to loop through an array, is using a for loop:

    <p>The best way to loop through an array is using a standard for loop:</p>

    <p id="demo"></p>


    <script>
        const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fruits.length ;
